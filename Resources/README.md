The repository is aimed to illustrate the source material one can follow if he/she wishes to learn Machine Learning.

Researchers

Many of the most well-known AI researchers have a strong presence on the web. Below I’ve listed around twenty and included links to their website, Wikipedia page, Twitter profile, Google Scholar profile, and Quora profile. Quite a few have done an Ask-Me-Anything on Reddit or a Quora Session so I’ve included that is well when applicable.

I could include dozens more in a list like this. See Quora for more names.

Video Courses
There are an overwhelming number of video courses and tutorials available online now — many of them free. There are some good paid options too, but for this article, I’m focusing exclusively on free content. There are considerably more college courses where the professor has made the course materials available online, but there are no videos. Those can be more challenging to follow along and you probably don’t need them. The following courses would keep you busy for months:

Coursera — Machine Learning (Andrew Ng)
Coursera — Neural Networks for Machine Learning (Geoffrey Hinton)
Udacity — Intro to Machine Learning (Sebastian Thrun)
Udacity — Machine Learning (Georgia Tech)
Udacity — Deep Learning (Vincent Vanhoucke)
